CreateTextjoin.gs is a Google Script that creates a function for scraping information from the web.
Once created, this sheet will take the name of a school in cell A2 and populate fields that can be copied and pasted into other documents.
I created this from scratch while working at TestBest doing data collection and it greatly increased my productivity.
This function needs to be run once and then the program can be used.
To create this function, open a new Google Sheet, click Tools>Script Editor, and paste the entire code in CreateTextjoin.gs over the default code. Then hit "Run" or the run arrow icon and the new sheet will be transformed into the textjoin sheet.


--Instructions For Use--

Input:
Input a private boarding school (that has a profile on boardingschoolreview.com) into cell A2.

Output:
Row 2 will be populated with formatted text ready to be pasted without formatting into the corresponding row in the data collection document.
